## üöÄ Final Project ‚Äì Speaker Identification and Gender Classification Using Audio Data

The final course project focused on **classifying both the gender and the identity of individuals using audio data**. Key highlights of the project:

- üîâ **Audio Preprocessing**: Extracting MFCCs and normalization  
- üß™ **Modeling**: Binary (gender) and multi-class (identity) classification  
- üõ† **Algorithms Used**:  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- üìä **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-validation  

The project successfully achieved high accuracy on both tasks using carefully extracted features and tuned models.
