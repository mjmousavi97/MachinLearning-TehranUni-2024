 ## üìö Projects

This repository is a growing collection of my machine learning projects.  
So far, I have completed and uploaded the following projects:

| # | Project Title                              | Description                                                                                     | Status       |
|---|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Apple vs Banana Image Classification      | Extracted features (mean intensity and channel intensity ratio) from apple and banana images, performed preprocessing, and classified them using simple threshold-based rules (without ML models). | ‚úÖ Completed |
| 2 | Naive Bayes Classifier (Manual vs. Library) | Implemented Naive Bayes from scratch to separate two classes and compared it with sklearn's implementation. | ‚úÖ Completed |
| 3 | Polynomial Regression Cross-Validation Simulation | Simulated data to analyze the impact of polynomial degree (1 to 25) on model performance using 10-fold cross-validation, computed mean & variance of MSE, and visualized bias-variance trade-off. | ‚úÖ Completed |

üöÄ More projects will be added soon as I continue exploring new ML techniques and datasets.

## üöÄ Final Project ‚Äì Speaker Identification and Gender Classification Using Audio Data

The final course project focused on **classifying both the gender and the identity of individuals using audio data**. Key highlights of the project:

- üîâ **Audio Preprocessing**: Extracting MFCCs and normalization  
- üß™ **Modeling**: Binary (gender) and multi-class (identity) classification  
- üõ† **Algorithms Used**:  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- üìä **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-validation  

The project successfully achieved high accuracy on both tasks using carefully extracted features and tuned models.
